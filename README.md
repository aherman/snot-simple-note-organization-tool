## Background & Purpose
This project started with the desire to organize my myriad ideas, notes and bookmarks in one single user-friendly place.

I had some additional technical goals:

 * Practice building a Javascript-based web application
 * Test out the Google Apps Script platform
 
 ## Technical Details

* Application server: Google Apps Script
* Database server: Google Fusion Tables
* Front-end languages used: Javascript, HTML, CSS
* Back-end languages used: Javascript
* Frameworks/libraries used: jQuery, Datatables, Bootstrap
 
 ## Status and Future
 
Since this project is mostly for personal use and learning, it is mostly a proof-of-concept and is currently not scalable to a larger user-base. It also needs some refactoring to make it more flexible and resilient.

Issues

* Improve database layer (scalability, resiliency)
* Apply front-end application framework
